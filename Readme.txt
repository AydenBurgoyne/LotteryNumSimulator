Purpose:
This is just a simple C++ program that tries to demonstrate the odds of winning the lotto by showing how many tries it takes the computer to randomly generate the winning number 

How to Run:
To run this program simply open in CLion and run, when asked to input a number enter one that is 10 digits long that does not start with 0.
The program will count how many random numbers were required before finding one that matched the winning number. 

This can take a long time so don't be alarmed if it takes a few mins.
